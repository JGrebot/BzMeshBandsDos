# EmpiricalPseudopotential
Band structure computation using empirical pseudopotentials


This repository was initially a fork from : [EmpiricalPseudopotential](https://github.com/aromanro/EmpiricalPseudopotential) of [Adrian Roman](https://compphys.go.ro/empirical-pseudopotential/).

## Features
You can do two types of calculations:
* Compute the electronic band structure over a path of high-symmetry points (e.g. $L\Gamma X U K \Gamma$) for a given material, and plot the results :

---

* Compute the electronic band structure over all k-points of an input mesh of the Brillouin Zone (or a fraction of it). The result can then be visualized, for example, through iso-energy surface:
